/*
The Character possesses an inventory of 4 slots, which means 4 Materias at most.
The inventory is empty at construction. They equip the Materias in the first empty slot
they find. This means, in this order: from slot 0 to slot 3. In case they try to add
a Materia to a full inventory, or use/unequip an unexisting Materia, don’t do anything
(but still, bugs are forbidden). The unequip() member function must NOT delete the
Materia!

Handle the Materias your character left on the floor as you like.

Save the addresses before calling unequip(), or anything else, but
don’t forget that you have to avoid memory leaks.

The use(int, ICharacter&) member function will have to use the Materia at the
slot[idx], and pass the target parameter to the AMateria::use function.
11


Your character’s inventory will be able to support any type of
AMateria.

Your Character must have a constructor taking its name as a parameter. Any copy
(using copy constructor or copy assignment operator) of a Character must be deep.
During copy, the Materias of a Character must be deleted before the new ones are added
to their inventory. Of course, the Materias must be deleted when a Character is destroyed.
