These two parameters are used when the list is used to erase elements from a range. The parameter first refers to the iterator pointing to the first
element in the range and the parameter last refers to the iterator pointing to the last element in the range which is needed to be erased. This erases all the
elements in the range including the element pointed by the iterator first but excluding the element pointed by the iterator last.
